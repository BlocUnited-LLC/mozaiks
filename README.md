## What is Mozaiks?

Mozaiks is an open-source AI app factory for building, running, and iterating on
AI-native software products.

It brings together three things that usually live in separate tools:

- **Mozaiks Console** for creating apps, continuing builds, and managing them.
- **AI workflow orchestration powered by AG2** for planning, tool use, human
  review, and generation.
- **Generated app files** with modules, pages, workflows, config, and brand
  assets that Mozaiks validates before making active.

The goal is not to generate a throwaway demo. Mozaiks stages production-shaped
artifacts, validates them against strict contracts, and keeps runtime concerns
separate from builder workflows.

## Quickstart

Install Python 3.11+ and Node.js 18+, then install the Mozaiks CLI:

```powershell
python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
pipx install mozaiks
```

Open a new PowerShell if `mozaiks` is not found after `ensurepath`, then start
the local Console workspace:

```powershell
mozaiks quickstart --dir .\mozaiks-workspace
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000/apps` and click `Create App`.

`.\mozaiks-workspace` is the local workspace folder Mozaiks uses for generated
output, config, and launch scripts. It is not the app itself. The app is
created later from inside the Console.

### Which Tool To Use

The **Console** is the browser product for creating apps, continuing builds,
reviewing artifacts, and managing apps. The **CLI** is just how you set up the
local workspace, start processes, run diagnostics, and open the Console.

If you see `studio`, it is just the internal server name behind the Console.
Most users can ignore it and start from the Console.

Main repo layout:

- `web_shell/` - local Vite shell host source
- `factory_app/app/` - first-party Console app bundle and default brand assets
- `factory_app/workflows/` - shared builder workflow root
