# Changelog

All notable changes to Mozaiks are tracked here.

This project follows a practical pre-1.0 changelog format:

- `Added` for new capabilities
- `Changed` for behavior, docs, packaging, or workflow changes
- `Fixed` for bug fixes
- `Deprecated` for supported behavior that will be removed later
- `Removed` for removed behavior
- `Security` for vulnerability or hardening work

## Unreleased

## 0.1.2 - 2026-05-14

### Changed

- Consolidated first-party console ownership under `factory_app/app/admin/pages/` and `factory_app/app/admin/index.js`, removing the legacy duplicate console surface path.
- Updated workspace console navigation to derive from route-manifest metadata (`meta.navigation.group`, `meta.navigation.icon`) instead of hardcoded sidebar arrays in `WorkspaceLayout`.
- Aligned route manifest contracts so workspace and app console routes declare explicit navigation inclusion/grouping semantics.

### Fixed

- Fixed active admin console page imports to resolve shared `ConsoleShared` primitives from the canonical `factory_app/app/ui/components/` location.
- Regenerated packaging manifest metadata (`mozaiks.egg-info/SOURCES.txt`) to remove stale references to deleted legacy console paths.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-05-14

### Added

- Standardized generated app scaffolds from `mozaiks init` with app-local `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, README, PowerShell launch scripts, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.claude` rules/skills for coding agents.
- Added Claude release-notes rules and skill guidance so release-impacting changes update this changelog proactively.
- Added `mozaiks sync-agent-guidance` to safely check, create, or update generated coding-agent guidance in existing app workspaces.
- Added AppGenerator UI primitive catalog injection, generated UI quality gates, and generated UI acceptance coverage so agents target shipped primitives instead of hallucinated UI components.
- Added module-contract quality checks and canonical module contract guidance for generated modules.
- Added Studio Console/App Console UX surfaces for app portfolio management, shell actions, notifications, and generated app lifecycle visibility.

### Changed

- Updated OSS setup docs to distinguish public package usage, source checkout dogfooding, and framework development.
- Reorganized public architecture docs around app, module system, workflows, frontend UI, builder, and MozaiksAI runtime sections.
- Updated factory app UI primitives, shell branding, and Console copy toward the production-grade app-management model.
- Aligned AppGenerator prompts, hooks, and structured-output guidance with the canonical module and generated UI contracts.

### Fixed

- Fixed PyPI project description media by using absolute GitHub asset URLs for the README logo and demo images.
- Fixed primitive catalog hook section replacement so injected guidance no longer truncates later agent instructions.
- Fixed primitive loader test isolation by exposing cache invalidation for cached UI primitive exports.

### Removed

- Removed stale public telemetry walkthroughs, old roadmap/spec docs, and duplicate prompt-pack docs that no longer match the canonical product and generator model.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Initial public PyPI release of the Mozaiks OSS framework.
- Packaged CLI entrypoint with `mozaiks --version`.
- Tag-driven GitHub Actions release flow for building, smoke-testing, creating a GitHub release, and publishing to PyPI.
